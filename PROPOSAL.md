# Library Management Application Proposal

## Project Overview

The Library Management Application is a web-based platform designed to manage a library's book inventory and user registrations. This application will provide functionalities for users to register and log in, as well as different levels of access permissions based on user roles. The primary roles include Librarian and Guest. Librarians will have the ability to add, edit, and delete books, while Guests will only have viewing privileges.

## Objectives

- Develop a user-friendly web interface for managing library operations.
- Implement secure user authentication and role-based access control.
- Ensure smooth interaction between the frontend and backend for book management.

## Features

### User Authentication

- **Registration**: Users can register by providing a username, password, and role (Librarian or Guest).
- **Login**: Users can log in using their credentials to access the application.

### Role-Based Access Control

- **Librarian**: Can add, edit, and delete books.
- **Guest**: Can view the list of books.

### Book Management

- **Add Book**: Librarians can add new books to the library.
- **Edit Book**: Librarians can update details of existing books.
- **Delete Book**: Librarians can remove books from the library.
- **View Books**: All users can view the list of books.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating a responsive and interactive user interface.
- Alpine.js for handling dynamic elements and frontend logic.

### Backend

- Node.js and Express for building the server and handling API requests.
- PostgreSQL for database management and storage of user and book data.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and session management.

### Environment and Tools

- Postman or Thunder Client for API testing.
- pgAdmin for managing PostgreSQL databases.
- Git for version control.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration

1. Initialize the project repository.
2. Set up the backend environment with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
3. Configure environment variables for database connection and JWT secret.

### Phase 2: User Authentication and Authorization

1. Implement user registration and login endpoints.
2. Set up JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.

### Phase 3: Book Management

1. Create endpoints for adding, editing, deleting, and viewing books.
2. Implement frontend forms and views for book management.

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

1. Test all endpoints using Postman or Thunder Client.

## Conclusion

This project aims to create a robust and secure library management application that simplifies the process of managing book inventories and user access. By leveraging modern web technologies and following best practices, we will deliver a high-quality product that meets the needs of librarians and library users alike.
